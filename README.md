## Picking up Laravel

While the major projects I've worked on at [Code Fanatics](https://www.codefanatics.co.uk) have involved complex REST/RPC APIs, they currently run on a bespoke MVC framework. Originally, they used [Fat-Free](https://fatfreeframework.com/). Along the way, we stripped out and replaced a lot of the functionality to be specific to our apps, in order to reduce the latency of our game APIs.

Since then, frameworks have come a long way, as has PHP itself. I wanted to update my knowledge in this area. I've used [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) in a small personal project, however I was interested in trying out full Laravel.

This repo is tracking the creation of a simple blog application for my personal website, with the pipe dream I would actually be able to use it afterwards.

#### Method

I started with a Udemy course on Laravel to grab the basic concepts and "Laravelly" approach. Since then I've continued with the application as I would in any other framework, while trying to ensure I take advantage of any functionality and shortcuts Laravel provides.
